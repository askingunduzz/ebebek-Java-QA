# ebebek-Java-QA
This file is for my application for ebebek Java&QA Practicum. 
I wrote a Java class named "Employee" and it is for fabric workers' name,work hours, hire year and salary.
Given these info, the code finds their new salary. 
Finally, it prints all the given information and the new salary.
